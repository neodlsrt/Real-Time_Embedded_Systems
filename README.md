# Real-Time_Embedded_Systems

This project focuses on the analysis and simulation of real-time systems, exploring how task scheduling, deadlines, and system constraints impact overall performance. It includes experiments and case studies designed to evaluate different scheduling strategies and their effects on timing guarantees and resource usage.

⚠️ Notes
- For a quick test to check if the code runs correctly, it is recommended to remove the last task τ7, as it causes the computation time to increase significantly (up to ~6 hours).
- To test the behavior when a task is allowed to miss its deadline, modify the task declarations between lines 110 and 116 by changing "False" to "True".
